<p>The 10-week residency at SFPC was compared to that of the Rabbit Hole from â€œAlice in Wonderland.â€ A place where one has free reign to explore topics in depth.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-want-_____">What do I want <strong>__</strong>___?</h3>

<p>to learn? to make? SFPC to be? We were all prompted with these questions on our first day. My responses follow.</p>

<h3 id="______-tolearn"><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><em>__</em> toÂ learn</h3>

<p>There are so many topics. Talking to my classmates, I am discovering more already. Topics I would like to explore are projection mapping, openCV, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more embedded systems.
Also, from a more holistic perspective, Iâ€™d like to gain better insight on the â€œcreative technologyâ€ field people keep talking about. There are many great people involved in the SFPC community. I feel like there are many things to learn from those involved.</p>

<h3 id="______-tomake"><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><em>__</em> toÂ make</h3>

<p>I would like to make an interactive art piece. Something that incorporates music, hardware, software, and projection mapping (if thereâ€™s time!). I also plan on collaborating with others, and to form more ideas to work on.</p>

<h3 id="______-sfpc-tobe"><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><em>__</em> SFPC toÂ be</h3>

<p>I want SFPC to be a place where people can collaborate and create incredible projects. I want it to be a community where the sum is greater than any of the parts.</p>
