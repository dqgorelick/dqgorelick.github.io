<p>I am looking for SFPC to be a time for growth. I will have to try to push the outcome-oriented part of my personality out, and welcome in the patient, present section.</p>

<p><em>That being said.</em></p>

<p>I want to produce a kick-ass project(s) during my time here.</p>

<p>Let’s boggie (aka brainstorm). Cue Cowboy Bebop intro song.</p>

<p>While I am very eager to start working on projects, I also want to spend time addressing what sorts of “soft skills” I can learn from my time here.</p>

<p>Not sure if soft skills is the right wording, but yeah, pretty much this: <code class="highlighter-rouge">!outcome</code>.</p>
