    description: "Worked with the Office for Creative Research to create a community space for map making. The end result was a pop-up installation in St Louis where maps were created by robots, projection, and drawn by hand by visitors to the space. Over the course of a month, 29 groups visited to create 100 maps that reflect the experience of the community who live in the city.<br/><br/>The problems I helped tackle were the mechanics and programming of the drawing robots. The project lent itself to a fantastic combination of software and hardware challenges. I worked on the robot‚Äôs control programs, the coordination / orchestration program, as well as prototyped and build the marker-drawing mechanism.<br/><br/>For more context on the motivation for the project by Jer Thorp: <a href='https://medium.com/@blprnt/making-mapping-more-human-77a96e92ed49' target='_blank'>Making Mapping More Human</a>.

Players can draw lines on an iPad which rests on a music stand in front of the projection, or can add additional voices on their mobile devices.<br><br>The player views and the visualization are web applications, and a Node.js server connects all of the pieces using websockets.
